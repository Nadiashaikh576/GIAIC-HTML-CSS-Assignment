    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
 <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
 <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about
 an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies
 of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all
 the other scientific journals her work had
 appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On
 The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book
 since college, and the longer she spent in these
 four walls the more she felt she needed to be
 free.</p>
 <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room,
 sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote
 proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of
 people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although
 many considered her pioneering work, unraveling
 the secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an
 outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think
 she had something better to do.</p>

        </p><h1>Scrambled Eggs</h1>
        <p>Eggs are one of my favourite foods. Here is a
        recipe for deliciously rich scrambled eggs.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1tbs butter</li>
        <li>2tbs cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a frying pan over a medium
        heat</li>
        <li>Gently mix the eggs and cream in a bowl</li>
        <li>Once butter has melted add cream and eggs</li>
        <li>Using a spatula fold the eggs from the edge of
        the pan to the center every 20 seconds (as if
        you are making an omelette)</li>
        <li>When the eggs are still moist remove from the
        heat (it will continue to cook on the plate
        until served)</li>
        </ol>
